- Feedback: Update licenses immediately with the references, as you find them. Otherwise you won't remember where you got them from (e.g. code from others). [Henry]
- Feedback: Remember you're only marked on your own program code. Almost nothing else.
- Feedback: This project is falling quite behind. I can't find 10-14 hours work for last week. Show me 10-14 hours each per week.. where was it spent? 
- Feedback: I want you to start writing the time taken per changelog item (in brackets at the end of each line), so that you can see where time is being spent / not being spent enough. [Henry]
